# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** All model catalog data accessible through a single GraphQL endpoint, eliminating the Fuseki dependency while maintaining REST API compatibility.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Schema and Data Migration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Schema and Data Migration)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-14 -- Completed plan 01-01 (ModelCatalog Schema Migration)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 16%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-schema-and-data-migration | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3 min
- Trend: N/A (only 1 plan completed)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Compressed 5 categories into 3 phases (SCHM+DATA, API, FKMG+CLNP) per "quick" depth
- [Roadmap]: ETL pipeline split into separate plan from schema design to allow parallel work on extraction while Hasura migration is built
- [01-01]: Made FK columns nullable to handle orphaned entities in RDF data
- [01-01]: Single parameter table with parameter_type column instead of separate Adjustment table
- [01-01]: Created 15 indexes covering all FK columns for query performance

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- FK migration (Phase 3) is highest risk -- mixed data in `model` table needs careful classification before migration
- Research confidence on migration strategy is MEDIUM -- specifics need validation against actual data
- Performance benchmarks of current system not yet captured (needed for Phase 2 contract testing)
